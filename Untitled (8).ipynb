    "Q1. EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE EACH WHEN TO USE A FOR LOOP AND A WHILE LOOP. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  for loop :\n",
    "A for loop is commonly used when you know the number of iterations you want to perform in advance. It is especially \n",
    "useful when you need to iterate over a known sequence, such as a list or an array.\n",
    "Let's say have a list of names and want to print each name on a separate line.\n",
    "Here's how you would use a for loop to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for name in names:\n",
    "    print(name)\n",
    "In this example, the for loop iterates over each element in the names list and assigns it to the variable name.\n",
    "The loop then executes the code block inside the loop, which simply prints each name. Since we know the length\n",
    "of the names list in advance, a for loop is a suitable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "while loop example:\n",
    "A while loop is used when you want to repeat a set of instructions as long as a certain condition remains true.\n",
    "It's commonly employed when the number of iterations is unknown or depends on dynamic factors.\n",
    "Suppose you want to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100. You can use a while loop to accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "counter = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while counter <= 100:\n",
    "    sum += counter\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Sum:\", sum)\n",
    "In this example, the while loop continues executing the code block as long as the condition counter <= 100 is true.\n",
    "The loop calculates the sum of numbers by adding the current value of counter to sum and increments counter by 1 in \n",
    "each iteration. This process continues until the condition becomes false, i.e., when counter reaches 101. Since we\n",
    "don't know in advance how many times the loop will execute, a while loop is appropriate here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, use a for loop when you have a fixed number of iterations or when iterating over a known sequence, \n",
    "and use a while loop when the number of iterations is unknown or depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
