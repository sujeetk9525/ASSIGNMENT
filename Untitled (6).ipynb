    "Q1.  WHAT IS EXCEPTION IN PYTHON ? WRITE THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN EXCEPTIONS AND SYNTAX ERRORS ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- An Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program.\n",
    "An exception is a Python object that represents an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur when there is a mistake in the structure or syntax of the Python code.\n",
    "These errors are usually detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase,\n",
    "before the program is executed.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the program from running and must be fixed before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, misspelled keywords, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an error or exceptional condition arises.\n",
    "Exceptions can be anticipated and handled by the programmer, allowing the program to respond gracefully to errors.\n",
    "Exceptions can be raised explicitly by the programmer or raised automatically by the Python interpreter when certain errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include division by zero (ZeroDivisionError), accessing a nonexistent File (FileNotFoundError),\n",
    "or trying to access \n",
    "a variable that is not defined (NameError).\n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, which allow the program to continue\n",
    "executing even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "Exceptions can also propagate up the call stack if they are not caught, potentially causing the program\n",
    "to terminate if they are not handled.\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are related to mistakes in the code structure and prevent the program from running,\n",
    "while exceptions are raised during\n",
    "program execution and can be handled to gracefully handle errors and exceptional conditions.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN EXCEPTION IS NOT HANDLED ? EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  When an exception is not handled in Python, it leads to the program terminating abruptly\n",
    "and an error message being displayed.\n",
    "Let's consider an example to understand what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def read_file(filename):\n",
    "    file = open(filename, 'r')\n",
    "    contents = file.read()\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "    return contents\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with a non-existent file\n",
    "file_contents = read_file('nonexistent_file.txt')\n",
    "print(file_contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the read_file function attempts to open a file and read its contents. However, if the file specified\n",
    "by filename does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception.\n",
    "If this exception is not handled within a try-except block, the Python interpreter will raise the exception \n",
    "and display an error message, like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ANOTHER EXAMPLE :--\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "def read_file(filename):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        file = open(filename, 'r')\n",
    "        contents = file.read()\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "        return contents\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: File '{filename}' not found.\")\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with a non-existent file\n",
    "file_contents = read_file('nonexistent_file.txt')\n",
    "print(file_contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this modified version, the try block encloses the code that may raise an exception. If a FileNotFoundError\n",
    "occurs, the exception is caught in the except block,\n",
    "allowing you to handle it gracefully. Here, a custom error message is printed, and None is returned instead \n",
    "of causing a program crash.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "By handling exceptions, you can control how your program responds to exceptional conditions, provide appropriate\n",
    "error messages, and ensure the program continues running without abrupt termination.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 :- WHICH PYTHON STATEMENTS ARE USED TO CATCH AND HANDLE EXCEPTIONS ? EXPLAIN WITH AND EXAMPLE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- In Python, the try-except statement is used to catch and handle exceptions. The try block contains the code\n",
    "that might raise an exception, and the except block is where you specify how to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of try-except:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with different arguments\n",
    "print(divide_numbers(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "print(divide_numbers(10, 0))  # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the divide_numbers function attempts to divide a by b.\n",
    "The try block encloses this division operation, which may raise a ZeroDivisionError if the value of b is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a ZeroDivisionError occurs, the exception is caught in the except block. In this case, a custom error\n",
    "message is printed, indicating that division by zero is not allowed. The function then returns None to \n",
    "indicate an error condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling the divide_numbers function with different arguments, you can observe how the exception \n",
    "is handled. If the division is possible (e.g., dividing 10 by 2), the result is returned and printed. \n",
    "If a division by zero is attempted, the exception is caught, and the custom error message is printed\n",
    "instead of the program terminating abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By using try-except blocks, you can handle specific exceptions and provide appropriate error handling logic.\n",
    "This allows your program to gracefully handle exceptional conditions and continue execution, rather\n",
    "than crashing due to unhandled exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 :- EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE ?\n",
    "TRY AND ELSE\n",
    "FINALLY\n",
    "RAISE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  Certainly! Let's explore the concepts of try-else, finally, and raise in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "try-else:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The try-else statement is used when you want to specify a block of code to be executed if no exceptions are raised\n",
    "in the try block. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Division successful. Result:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with different arguments\n",
    "divide_numbers(10, 2)  # Output: Division successful. Result: 5.0\n",
    "divide_numbers(10, 0)  # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the try block attempts to divide a by b. If a ZeroDivisionError occurs, the exception is caught\n",
    "in the except block and an error message is printed. However, if no exception is raised, the else block is executed,\n",
    "indicating that the division was successful and printing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "The finally statement is used to define a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an \n",
    "exception occurs or not. It is commonly used for cleanup operations. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def open_and_read_file(filename):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        file = open(filename, 'r')\n",
    "        contents = file.read()\n",
    "        return contents\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: File '{filename}' not found.\")\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        if 'file' in locals():\n",
    "            file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with a file that exists\n",
    "file_contents = open_and_read_file('existing_file.txt')\n",
    "print(file_contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with a non-existent file\n",
    "file_contents = open_and_read_file('nonexistent_file.txt')\n",
    "print(file_contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the try block attempts to open and read the contents of a file specified by filename.\n",
    "If a FileNotFoundError occurs, the exception is caught in the except block and an error message is printed.\n",
    "Regardless of whether an exception is raised or not, the finally block is executed, closing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "raise:\n",
    "The raise statement is used to manually raise an exception in Python. EXAMPLE :\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n",
    "    factorial = 1\n",
    "    for i in range(1, n+1):\n",
    "        factorial *= i\n",
    "    return factorial\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with different arguments\n",
    "print(calculate_factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n",
    "print(calculate_factorial(-2)) # Output: ValueError: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the calculate_factorial function calculates the factorial of a given number n. \n",
    "Before performing the calculation, it checks if n is negative. If it is, a ValueError is raised using the \n",
    "raise statement, with a custom error message. If n is non-negative, the factorial is calculated and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using raise, WE can create an own exceptions to handle specific error conditions in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the features in Python that allow you to handle exceptions, control program flow, and raise custom\n",
    "exceptions when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5 :- WHAT ARE CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS IN PYTHON ? WHY DO NEED CUSTOM EXCEPTION ? EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  \n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exception classes that inherit from the base Exception class or its subclasses. \n",
    "They allow you to define your own specific exception types to handle unique error conditions in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for custom exceptions arises when you encounter situations that are not adequately covered by the built-in exception\n",
    "classes. By creating custom exceptions, you can provide more specific information about the error, add additional attributes or \n",
    "methods to the exception class, and handle the exceptional conditions in a tailored manner. Custom exceptions enhance \n",
    "the clarity and maintainability of your code by signaling and handling specific error scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the use of custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, amount, balance):\n",
    "        self.amount = amount\n",
    "        self.balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Insufficient funds. Amount: {self.amount}, Balance: {self.balance}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def withdraw(balance, amount):\n",
    "    if amount > balance:\n",
    "        raise InsufficientFundsError(amount, balance)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        balance -= amount\n",
    "        print(\"Withdrawal successful.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the custom exception in code\n",
    "balance = 1000\n",
    "withdraw_amount = 1500\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    withdraw(balance, withdraw_amount)\n",
    "except InsufficientFundsError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception class called InsufficientFundsError, which inherits from the base \n",
    "Exception class. The custom exception takes two parameters: amount (the withdrawal amount) and balance (the account balance).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The withdraw function simulates a withdrawal operation from an account. If the withdrawal amount exceeds\n",
    "the account balance, it raises the InsufficientFundsError with the appropriate arguments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the main code, we attempt to withdraw an amount that exceeds the account balance. The withdraw function raises the \n",
    "InsufficientFundsError, and we catch it in the except block. The custom exception object is then printed, displaying\n",
    "the amount and balance in the error message.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "By using custom exceptions, you can handle specific error conditions more precisely and provide meaningful error messages.\n",
    "They allow you to encapsulate and communicate exceptional scenarios effectively, making your code more robust and maintainable.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- \n",
    "Certainly! Here's an example of creating a custom exception class and using it to handle an exception:\n",

    "        self.input_value = input_value\n",

    "    print(e)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception class called InvalidInputError, which inherits from the base\n",
    "Exception class. The custom exception takes the input_value as a parameter in its constructor.\n",
    "              \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The process_input function simulates processing an input value. If the input value is not an integer, it raises the\n",
    "InvalidInputError with the given value.\n",
