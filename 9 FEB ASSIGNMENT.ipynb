    "AN example of a Vehicle class with an __init__ method that initializes instance variables\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, getter and setter methods are used to provide controlled access to class attributes \n",
    "or properties. They are used to retrieve and modify the values of private or protected attributes.\n",
    "The getter method retrieves the value of an attribute, while the setter method\n",
    "sets or updates the value of an attribute, allowing for encapsulation and data validation.\n",
    "\n",

    "print(name)  # Output: John\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a Person class with a private attribute _name. \n",
    "The getter method get_name retrieves the value of the _name attribute, \n",

    "The setter method includes a simple data validation check to ensure that\n",
    "the name provided is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating an instance of the Person class, we can use the setter method set_name\n",
    "to set the name attribute to \"John\". We can then use the getter method get_name \n",
    "to retrieve the value of the name attribute, which will be \"John\". The use of \n",
    "getter and setter methods allows us to control access to the attribute and \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- Method overriding is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a subclass\n",
    "to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "This allows the subclass to inherit the method from the superclass but modify its behavior to suit its specific needs.\n",

    "class Animal:\n",

    "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",

    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the overridden method on each instance\n",
    "animal.make_sound()  # Output: Animal makes a sound\n",
    "dog.make_sound()     # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "cat.make_sound()     # Output: Cat meows\n",
    "\n",

    "In the above example, we have a base class Animal with a method make_sound(). The Dog and Cat classes inherit \n",
