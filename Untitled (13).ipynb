    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  When creating a custom exception in a programming language, it is important to derive\n",
    "it from the base exception class provided by the language. In most programming languages, \n",
    "including Python, Java, and C++. \n",
    "this base exception class is typically called \"Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions offers several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance: By deriving our custom exception from the base Exception class, we automatically\n",
    "inherit all the properties and behaviors of the Exception class. This includes methods and \n",
    "attributes that are useful for handling and propagating exceptions, such as the ability to \n",
    "print an exception traceback, retrieve the exception message, or handle exceptions in a structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standardization: The Exception class represents a standardized and well-defined way of handling exceptions.\n",
    "By adhering to this standard, we make our custom exception consistent with other built-in or library-provided \n",
    "exceptions, which enhances the clarity and maintainability of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compatibility: Many existing codebases, frameworks, and libraries are designed to work with the built-in \n",
    "exception hierarchy. By using the Exception class as the base class for our custom exception, we ensure \n",
    "compatibility with these existing components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Catch-all: By using the Exception class as the base class, our custom exception can be caught by \n",
    "a catch block that catches generic exceptions. This can be useful when we want to catch and handle \n",
    "multiple types of exceptions in a single block. If our custom exception doesn't inherit from the Exception class,\n",
    "it won't be caught by such catch blocks, leading to unhandled exceptions and potential program crashes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- \n",
    "The ArithmeticError class is a base class for all arithmetic errors in Python.\n",
    "It provides a common base for exceptions related to numerical computations. \n",
    "Some errors defined in the ArithmeticError class include FloatingPointError,\n",
    "OverflowError, and ZeroDivisionError. \n",
    "Explain two of these errors with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FloatingPointError:\n",
    "The FloatingPointError is raised when a floating-point arithmetic operation fails due to an \n",
    "invalid operation, such as an overflow or underflow. It is a subclass of ArithmeticError.\n",
    "This error typically occurs when performing mathematical calculations that result \n",
    "in a floating-point value that is too large or too small to be represented accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: try:\n",
    "    result = 1e1000 / 1e-1000   # A very large number divided by a very small number\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "except FloatingPointError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"FloatingPointError:\",\n",

    "FloatingPointError: floating point division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    "          \n",
    "          \n",
    "2. ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "The ZeroDivisionError is raised when a division or modulo operation is performed with a divisor of zero.\n",
    "It is a subclass of ArithmeticError. This error occurs when we attempt to divide a number by zero, \n",
    "which is an invalid arithmetic operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "result = 10 / 0   # Dividing by zero\n",

    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    "          \n",
    "In this example, we try to divide the number 10 by zero. Division by zero is mathematically undefined,\n",

    "Q4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  The LookupError class is a base class for exceptions that occur when a lookup or \n",
    "indexing operation fails. It provides a common base for exceptions related to searching or \n",
    "accessing elements in sequences, mappings, or other data structures. Two common subclasses \n",
    "of LookupError are KeyError and IndexError. Let's explain each of them with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError:\n",
    "          \n",
    "The KeyError is raised when a dictionary key or a set element is not found during a lookup operation.\n",
    "It occurs when we try to access a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "dictionary = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "value = dictionary['c']   # Trying to access a non-existent key\n",
    "print(value)\n",
    "except KeyError as e:\n",
    "print(\"KeyError:\", e)\n",
    "          \n",
    "OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError: 'c'\n",
    "          \n",
    "          \n",
    "IndexError:\n",
    "The IndexError is raised when an index is out of range during a sequence indexing operation. \n",
    "It occurs when we try to access an element from a sequence (such as a list or a string)\n",
    "using an index that is outside the valid range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "sequence = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "value = sequence[3]   # Trying to access an element with an invalid index\n",
    "print(value)\n",
    "except IndexError as e:\n",
    "print(\"IndexError:\", e)\n",
    "\n",
    "OUTPUT\n",
    "          \n",
    "          \n",
    "IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the sequence contains three elements, and we try to access the element at index 3.\n",
    "However, since indexing in Python starts from 0, the valid indices for this sequence are 0, 1, and 2. \n",
    "Trying to access an element at index 3 raises an IndexError with the message \"list index out of range.\"\n",

    "Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- ImportError:\n",
    "The ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find or load a module. \n",
    "It occurs when Python encounters difficulties in importing a module, which can happen \n",
    "due to various reasons such as a missing module, an invalid module name, \n",

    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-\n",
    "          \n",
    "1. Use multiple except blocks: When handling multiple exceptions, use separate except blocks\n",
    "for each exception type. This allows you to handle different exceptions differently \n",
    "and provides better clarity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use finally block for cleanup: When working with resources that need to be released, \n",
    "such as file handles or network connections, use a finally block to ensure that cleanup\n",
    "operations are always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avoid bare except: Avoid using a bare except block (without specifying any exception type) \n",
    "as it can hide potential bugs and make debugging difficult. Only catch exceptions\n",
    "that you are explicitly prepared to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Handle exceptions at the appropriate level of your code.\n",
    "Catch exceptions where you can effectively handle them or where you need to take specific actions based\n",
    "on the exception. Propagate exceptions up the call stack if they cannot be handled effectively at the current level.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Provide meaningful error messages: When raising or catching exceptions, include informative error messages. \n",
    "This helps in understanding the cause of the exception and aids in troubleshooting and debugging.\n",
