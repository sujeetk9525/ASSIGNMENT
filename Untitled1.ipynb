    "Q1. WHAT IS A DATABASE ? DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SQL AND NOSQL DATADASES.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured manner. It provides \n",
    "a way to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently. Databases are widely used in various applications, \n",
    "ranging from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems (DBMS)\n",
    "that differ in their data models, query languages, and design principles. \n",
    "Here's a comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases use a structured data model based on tables with predefined schemas. The data is organized \n",
    "into rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a standardized\n",
    "way to interact with databases, allowing users to perform complex operations such as filtering, sorting, joining, \n",
    "and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Schema and Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce strict schemas, meaning the structure of the data must be defined \n",
    "in advance. Changes to the schema often require altering the database structure, which can be time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increasing workloads \n",
    "by adding more resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to a single server. Some SQL databases also provide limited \n",
    "horizontal scalability through sharding or replication techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases: SQL databases are commonly used in applications that require complex data relationships, transactions,\n",
    "and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees. They are suitable for structured data and\n",
    "are widely used in traditional enterprise systems and applications like e-commerce, banking, and human resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph-based models.\n",
    "They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexibility in data representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: NoSQL databases offer different query languages depending on the data model used.\n",
    "Some provide custom query languages tailored to specific data models, while others support a subset\n",
    "of SQL or use APIs for data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Schema and Data Flexibility: NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility, allowing data to be stored \n",
    "without a predefined schema. This means that the structure of the data can evolve and change \n",
    "over time without requiring modifications to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed for horizontal scalability, meaning they\n",
    "can handle increasing  workloads by distributing data across multiple servers (clustered or distributed systems).\n",
    "They can scale out by adding more servers to the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases: NoSQL databases are suitable for applications with large amounts of rapidly changing and unstructured\n",
    "data, such as social media, real-time analytics, content management systems, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.\n",
    "They provide high performance, scalability, and flexibility for handling diverse data types and high data volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define\n",
    "and manage the structure of a database and its objects. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting\n",
    "database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL statements and their purposes, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or constraints.\n",
    "It specifies the name of the object, the columns or attributes it contains, and any additional properties or constraints. \n",
    "Here's an example of creating a table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "The above SQL statement creates a table named \"employees\" with columns for ID, name, age, and salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table or view, from the database. \n",
    "It permanently removes the object and all associated data. Here's an example of dropping a table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "The above SQL statement deletes the \"employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure or properties of an existing database object. It allows you to add,\n",
    "modify, or drop columns, change data types, or apply constraints. Here's an example of altering a table to add a new column:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "The above SQL statement modifies the \"employees\" table by adding a new column named \"department\" with a data type of VARCHAR(50).\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all data from a table, but it retains the structure of the table. It is faster \n",
    "than the DROP statement for large tables because it does not generate transaction logs. Here's an example of truncating a table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "The above SQL statement removes all data from the \"employees\" table, but the table structure remains intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL statements (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) are powerful tools for managing the structure and objects of a database.\n",
    "They allow you to define new objects, delete existing ones, modify structures, and manage data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to use these statements with caution as they directly impact the database structure and data.\n",
    "Always take appropriate backups and ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute DDL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. WHAT IS DML? EXPLAIN INSERT, UPDATE, AND DELETE WITH AN EXAMPLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to perform\n",
    "operations that manipulate or modify data within a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete \n",
    "records in database tables.\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DML statements and their purposes, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new records or rows into a table. It allows you to specify the values for\n",
    "each column or a subset of columns in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of inserting a new record into a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 5000.00);\n",
    "The above SQL statement inserts a new record into the \"employees\" table with values for the ID, name, age, and salary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or \n",
    "more columns based on specified conditions. Here's an example of updating a record in a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET salary = 5500.00\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "The above SQL statement updates the \"salary\" column of the record in the \"employees\" table where the \n",
    "ID is 1. It changes the salary value from 5000.00 to 5500.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more records from a table. It allows you to specify \n",
    "conditions to determine which records to delete. Here's an example of deleting a record from a table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "The above SQL statement deletes the record from the \"employees\" table where the ID is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are used to manipulate data within a database. They allow you \n",
    "to insert new records, update existing records, and delete unwanted records from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to use these statements with caution as they directly impact the data within the database.\n",
    "Always verify the conditions and ensure you have appropriate permissions to execute DML statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve and \n",
    "query data from a database. DQL statements are focused on retrieving data and do not involve data manipulation or\n",
    "schema modification. The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which allows you to retrieve specific data \n",
    "from one or more database tables based on specified conditions.\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT statement is used to query and retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.\n",
    "It allows you to specify the columns to retrieve, filter the data using conditions, sort the result set, \n",
    "and perform various calculations or transformations on the data. Here's an example of using SELECT:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table named \"employees\" with columns for ID, name, age, and salary. To retrieve all \n",
    "the records from the table, you can use the following SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "The above SQL statement retrieves all the columns (using the asterisk symbol *) from the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve specific columns, you can specify them in the SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, age\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "The above SQL statement retrieves only the \"name\" and \"age\" columns from the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the WHERE clause to filter the data based on certain conditions. For example, \n",
    "to retrieve employees with a salary greater than 5000:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE salary > 5000;\n",
    "The above SQL statement retrieves the \"name\" and \"salary\" columns from the \"employees\" table\n",
    "for employees whose salary is greater than 5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT statements can also include aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, etc., \n",
    "to perform calculations on the data. For example, to retrieve the total salary of all employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT SUM(salary)\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "The above SQL statement calculates and retrieves the sum of the \"salary\" column from the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is a powerful tool for retrieving and querying data from a database. It allows\n",
    "you to specify the desired columns, apply filtering conditions, sort the results, and perform various \n",
    "calculations on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. EXPLAIN PRIMARY KEY AND FOREIGN KEY.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each \n",
    "row or record in that table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data within the table. \n",
    "Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: A primary key must have unique values for each row in the table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Null: A primary key cannot have a null or empty value. Every row must have a valid value for the primary key.\n",
    "Indexing: A primary key is automatically indexed by the database system, which improves the performance of data retrieval\n",
    "and enforces faster data lookups.\n",
    "Single or Composite: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns, forming a composite key.\n",
    "Importance: Primary keys are crucial for data integrity and serve as a reference point for establishing relationships\n",
    "with other tables in a relational database.\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that establishes a link or relationship \n",
    "between the data in two tables. It represents a connection between a column in one table and the primary\n",
    "key of another table. Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, typically between the primary\n",
    "key column of one table and a corresponding column in another table.\n",
    "Referential Integrity: A foreign key enforces referential integrity, ensuring that the values in the \n",
    "foreign key column of one table match the values in the primary key column of the referenced table.\n",
    "Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can define cascading actions such as ON DELETE and ON UPDATE. These \n",
    "actions define what happens to the related records in the referenced table when a corresponding record is deleted or updated in the primary table.\n",
    "Multiple Foreign Keys: A table can have multiple foreign keys, allowing it to establish relationships with different tables based on different columns.\n",
    "Data Integrity: Foreign keys help maintain data consistency and integrity by enforcing relational constraints between tables.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider two tables: \"Employees\" and \"Departments.\" The \"Employees\" table has a primary key column named \"employee_id,\" and the \"Departments\" table has a primary key column named \"department_id.\" To establish a relationship between these tables, we can use a foreign key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"Employees\" table, we can add a foreign key column named \"department_id\" that references the \"department_id\" column in the \"Departments\" table. This foreign key column establishes a link between the two tables, indicating which department each employee belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining the foreign key relationship, we can ensure that an employee's department ID in the \"Employees\" table matches a valid department ID in the \"Departments\" table. This maintains referential integrity and allows us to retrieve information about employees and their corresponding departments efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primary keys uniquely identify records within a table, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables by linking the primary key of one table to a column in another table. These key concepts are fundamental to maintaining data integrity and establishing connections in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- To connect MySQL to Python, you can use the \"mysql-connector-python\" module. You need to install this module using pip before using it in your code. Here's an example code to connect MySQL to Python and explain the cursor() and execute() methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MySQL\n",
    "mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "  host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "  user=\"yourusername\",\n",
    "  password=\"yourpassword\",\n",
    "  database=\"yourdatabase\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object\n",
    "mycursor = mydb.cursor()\n",
    "Explanation of cursor() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The cursor() method is used to create a cursor object, which allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "The cursor acts as a pointer or reference to a specific location in the result set. It enables you to perform various operations such as executing queries, fetching data, and managing transactions.\n",
    "Explanation of execute() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The execute() method is used to execute an SQL query or statement using the cursor object.\n",
    "You can pass the SQL query as a string parameter to the execute() method. It then sends the query to the MySQL database for execution.\n",
    "The execute() method returns the result of the executed query, if applicable.\n",
    "Here's an example of using the execute() method to execute a SELECT query and fetch the result:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Execute a SELECT query\n",
    "mycursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM employees\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch all rows from the result set\n",
    "result = mycursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print each row\n",
    "for row in result:\n",
    "  print(row)\n",
    "In the above example, the execute() method is used to execute a SELECT query to retrieve all rows from the \"employees\" table. The fetchall() method is then used to fetch all the rows from the result set, and a loop is used to print each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to replace \"localhost\", \"yourusername\", \"yourpassword\", and \"yourdatabase\" with the appropriate values for your MySQL connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods, cursor() and execute(), are essential when working with MySQL and Python. They allow you to establish a connection, create a cursor object, and execute SQL queries to interact with the MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. GIVE THE ORDER OF EXECUTION OF SQL CLAUSES IN AN SQL QUERY.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query typically follows the logical sequence outlined below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns or expressions to retrieve from the database.\n",
    "It is usually the first clause in an SQL query and defines the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. FROM: The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which the data will be retrieved.\n",
    "It identifies the source of the data for the SELECT clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter the rows based on specified conditions. It allows you to specify \n",
    "criteria to retrieve only the rows that meet the specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used to group the rows based on one or more columns. It is typically used with \n",
    "aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., to perform calculations on each group of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the grouped rows based on specified conditions.\n",
    "It allows you to specify criteria to retrieve only the groups that meet the specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on specified columns. \n",
    "It allows you to specify the sorting order (ascending or descending) for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. LIMIT/OFFSET: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used for result set pagination. The LIMIT clause specifies \n",
    "the maximum number of rows to retrieve, and the OFFSET clause specifies the starting point of the retrieved rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query. The clauses you use and their\n",
    "order depend on the specific requirements of your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of an SQL query that demonstrates the order of execution\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table\n",
    "WHERE condition\n",
    "GROUP BY column1\n",
    "HAVING condition\n",
    "ORDER BY column1 ASC\n",
    "LIMIT 10\n",
    "OFFSET 20;\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the SELECT clause is followed by the FROM clause, WHERE clause, GROUP BY clause,\n",
    "HAVING clause, ORDER BY clause, and finally the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the order of execution of SQL clauses helps in constructing correct and efficient SQL queries.\n",
