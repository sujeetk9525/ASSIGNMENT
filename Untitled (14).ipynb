    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. \n",
    "A thread is a lightweight sub-process that can perform tasks independently, sharing the same memory space as other\n",
    "threads within the same process. Multithreading is used to achieve parallelism and improve the efficiency of \n",
    "programs by allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multithreading is used for several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCURRENCY : Multithreading enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks, allowing programs to make progress on\n",
    "multiple tasks at the same time. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, where threads can perform \n",
    "operations like reading from or writing to files, making network requests, or interacting with databases\n",
    "without blocking the execution of other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESPONSIVENESS : By using threads, you can keep the main program responsive while executing time-consuming tasks\n",
    "in the background. For example, you can use threads to perform lengthy computations or handle user interface \n",
    "updates concurrently, ensuring that the program remains interactive and doesn't appear to hang or freeze.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESOURSE SHARING : Threads can share data and resources within the same process. This allows for efficient \n",
    "communication and coordination between different parts of a program. However, \n",
    "it's important to synchronize access to shared resources to prevent race conditions or data corruption.\n",

    "Q2. Why threading module used? rite the use of the following functions\n",
    "1. activeCount()\n",
    "2. currentThread()\n",
    "3. enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- The threading module in Python is used for creating and managing threads. It provides a high-level\n",
    "interface and several functions and classes to handle threads effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "activeCount(): This function is used to retrieve the number of currently active Thread objects in the current \n",
    "thread's ThreadGroup. It returns an integer representing the number of active threads. The active\n",
    "threads include both daemon and non-daemon threads. This function can be helpful \n",
    "for monitoring the number of active threads in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "currentThread(): This function returns the currently executing Thread object. It is typically used to obtain a \n",
    "reference to the current thread within a thread's code. By calling currentThread(), you can access properties\n",
    "and methods associated with the current thread, such as its name, identification number (ident), or other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "enumerate(): The enumerate() function returns a list of all currently active Thread objects. It is useful for\n",
    "obtaining a list of all threads that are currently running or alive. The returned list includes both daemon\n",
    "and non-daemon threads. Each thread is represented by a Thread object, which can be used to access\n",
    "various attributes and methods associated with each thread.\n",

    "Q3. Explain the following functions\n",
    "1. run()\n",
    "2. start()\n",
    "3. join()\n",
    "4. isAlive()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- run(): The run() method is the entry point for the thread's activity. It is the method that will be\n",
    "executed when a thread is started. By default, it calls the target function passed during\n",
    "the thread's initialization. WE can also override this method in a custom Thread subclass \n",
    "to define the specific behavior that should be executed when the thread starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "start(): The start() method is used to start the execution of a thread. It creates a new thread of execution\n",
    "and calls the run() method internally. Once start() is called, the thread is scheduled by the Python\n",
    "interpreter to run concurrently with other threads. It's important to note that you should never call run()\n",
    "directly, as it will execute the target function in the same thread, without any concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "join(): The join() method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When join() is called on a thread,\n",
    "the calling thread is blocked until the target thread finishes its execution. This allows for synchronization,\n",
    "ensuring that the main thread or any other thread waits for the completion of a specific thread before proceeding.\n",
    "Additionally, can provide timeout value to join() to specify the maximum amount of time to wait for the thread to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "isAlive(): The isAlive() method is used to check if a thread is currently active or alive. It returns a boolean value \n",
    "indicating whether the thread is still running. If the thread has completed its execution or hasn't been started yet, \n",
    "isAlive() will return False. This method is often used to check the status of a thread and\n",
    "take appropriate actions based on its current state.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Concurrency and Parallelism: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of multiple tasks, \n",
    "leading to increased efficiency and the potential for parallelism on systems with multiple cores.\n",
    "It enables tasks to progress simultaneously and utilize available system resources effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness and Improved User Experience: By using multithreading, you can keep the user interface responsive\n",
    "while performing time-consuming tasks in the background. This prevents the program from freezing or becoming \n",
    "unresponsive, enhancing the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Threads can share memory and resources within the same process, allowing efficient communication\n",
    "and coordination between different parts of a program. This can lead to better utilization of system resources\n",
    "and increased program efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Program Structure: Multithreading can simplify the design and structure of certain programs by \n",
    "dividing complex tasks into smaller, manageable threads. This can improve code organization, readability,\n",
    "and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Complexity and Difficulty of Debugging: Multithreaded programs can be more challenging to develop and debug compared \n",
    "to single-threaded programs. Issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and thread synchronization errors can occur,\n",
    "making it harder to identify and resolve bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization Overhead: When multiple threads access shared resources, careful synchronization is required to \n",
    "prevent data corruption or inconsistent states. Implementing proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks \n",
    "or semaphores, can introduce additional overhead and complexity to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Determinism and Potential for Non-deterministic Behavior: Multithreading can introduce non-deterministic \n",
    "behavior due to the unpredictability of thread scheduling and execution. This can make it harder to reproduce \n",
    "and debug certain issues, as the order of thread execution may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Memory Usage: Each thread requires additional memory resources for its stack and execution context.\n",
    "In programs with a large number of threads or heavy thread usage, this can lead to increased memory usage \n",
    "and potentially impact overall system performance.\n",

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources \n",
    "or perform a certain action. In a deadlock situation, the threads are unable to proceed, resulting in a program\n",
    "freeze or deadlock state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Exclusion: Resources involved in the deadlock can only be used by one thread at a time (e.g., locks).\n",
    "Hold and Wait: A thread holds a resource while waiting to acquire additional resources.\n",
    "No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread; they can only be released voluntarily.\n",
    "Circular Wait: A cycle exists in the resource allocation graph, where each thread is waiting for a resource held by another thread.\n",
    "To prevent deadlocks, it is crucial to ensure that at least one of the deadlock conditions is not met. \n",
    "Strategies such as resource ordering, deadlock detection algorithms, and deadlock avoidance techniques \n",
    "can be employed to mitigate the risk of deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative ordering or timing of events, \n",
    "which can lead to unpredictable or incorrect results. It arises when multiple threads access shared resources \n",
    "or modify shared data concurrently without proper synchronization. Race conditions can result in data corruption,\n",
    "inconsistent states, or unexpected output.\n",
    "Race conditions typically occur due to the interleaved execution of threads, where the order of execution \n",
    "and access to shared resources are non-deterministic. To prevent race conditions, synchronization mechanisms\n",
    "like locks, semaphores, or mutexes are employed to ensure exclusive access to shared resources. By properly\n",
    "synchronizing the access to shared data, race conditions can be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that both deadlocks and race conditions can be complex to detect and debug. \n",
    "Proper understanding of concurrent programming principles, careful design, and the use of synchronization\n",
    "mechanisms are essential to avoid these issues and ensure the correctness and reliability of multithreaded programs.\n",
