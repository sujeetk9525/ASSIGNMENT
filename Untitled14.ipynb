    "Q1. Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system. It is designed to store and retrieve \n",
    "data in a flexible and scalable manner. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model,\n",
    "where data is stored in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, such as MongoDB, are characterized by their ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured\n",
    "data. They do not enforce a fixed schema like SQL databases, allowing for more flexibility in data storage. \n",
    "Non-relational databases excel in scenarios where data requirements are evolving, and there is a need for high \n",
    "scalability, performance, and agility.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible and dynamic data: When dealing with data that can change frequently or have varying structures,\n",
    "MongoDB's document model allows for easy and dynamic schema modifications. This is particularly useful in \n",
    "scenarios like content management systems, product catalogs, or social media platforms where data can have\n",
    "different attributes for each entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Big data and high scalability: MongoDB is designed to handle large-scale data sets and high throughput. It can\n",
    "distribute data across multiple servers, providing horizontal scalability. This makes it suitable for applications\n",
    "with rapidly growing  data or high traffic loads,such as real-time analytics, IoT data storage, or large-scale\n",
    "e-commerce platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rapid development and prototyping: MongoDB's flexible schema and expressive query language make it well-suited\n",
    "for agile development practices. It allows developers to iterate quickly and adapt the data model as the application\n",
    "evolves, without  the need for complex migrations. This is advantageous  in scenarios where rapid prototyping or\n",
    "frequent changes to the  data structure are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Geospatial and real-time data: MongoDB includes advanced geospatial indexing and querying capabilities, \n",
    "making it good choice for applications that deal with location-based data, such as mapping services, geolocation\n",
    "tracking, or location-based recommendations. Additionally, MongoDB's support for real-time data replication\n",
    "and change streams enables building reactive and event-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases depends on various factors, including the \n",
    "specific requirements  of the application, the nature of the data, and the expertise of the development team. Each \n",
    "database type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should be based on the specific needs the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- MongoDB offers several key features that contribute to its popularity and versatility as a NoSQL database \n",
    "management system. Here are some of its prominent features:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Document-oriented: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in flexible and \n",
    "self-contained  documents. Documents are similar to JSON objects and can have varying structures, allowing \n",
    "for dynamic and evolving schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indexing and Querying: MongoDB provides various indexing options to optimize query performance. It supports\n",
    "multiple types of indexes, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, and geospatial indexes. Its powerful\n",
    "query language includes a wide range of operators and functions for querying and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Full-text Search: MongoDB offers full-text search capabilities, enabling efficient text-based querying and indexing.\n",
    "SUPPORT various search features like text indexes, language-specific stemming, case insensitivity, and relevance scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change Streams and Real-time Data: MongoDB supports change streams, which allow developers to capture real-time\n",
    "data changes at the database level. Change streams enable building reactive and event-driven applications, facilitating\n",
    "real-time data synchronization, notifications, and stream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability and Performance: MongoDB is designed for high scalability and performance. It supports horizontal scaling \n",
    "through sharding, which enables distributing data across multiple servers to handle large data volumes high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Flexible Schema: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for easy schema evolution. It does not enforce a rigid structure, \n",
    "enabling developers to modify the schema without affecting existing data. This flexibility is particularly useful\n",
    "in agile development environments where requirements change frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a vibrant community and a wide ecosystem of tools, drivers, and frameworks.\n",
    "It provides official drivers for multiple programming languages, making it accessible for developers across different \n",
    "platforms. Additionally, MongoDB offers cloud-based services like MongoDB Atlas, providing managed database hosting \n",
    "and additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- To connect MongoDB to Python, you can use the PyMongo library, which is the official Python driver for MongoDB. \n",
    "Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates connecting to MongoDB, creating a database, and a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- Here's an example code snippet that uses the database and collection created in Question 3 to \n",
    "insert one record and multiple records, and then uses the find() and find_one() methods to print the\n",
    "inserted record(s):\n",

    "    \n",
    "Then, we insert multiple records using the insert_many() method with a list of dictionaries\n",
    "representing the documents to be inserted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To print the inserted records, we use the find() method to retrieve all documents from the \n",
    "collection and iterate over the returned cursor to print each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we use the find_one() method to retrieve a single document \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to\n",
    "demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- The find() method in MongoDB allows you to query the database and retrieve documents that\n",
    "match specific criteria. It provides a flexible and powerful way to filter and retrieve data\n",
    "based on various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the find() method, you provide a query filter as a parameter that specifies the conditions \n",
    "for document selection. The filter is typically a dictionary containing key-value pairs representing \n",
    "the fields and their corresponding values to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple code example that demonstrates how to use the find() method to query a MongoDB database,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",

    "    \n",
    "In the code above, after connecting to the MongoDB server and accessing the specified\n",
    "database and collection, we insert some sample documents using the insert_many() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define a filter query using the $gt (greater than) operator to match documents \n",
    "where the \"age\" field is greater than 30. The filter query is {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}}.\n",
    "\n",
    "We pass this filter query as a parameter to the find() method, which returns a cursor\n",
    "pointing to the matched documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we iterate over the cursor using a loop and print each matched document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We modify the filter query based on your specific criteria and the structure of\n",
    "your documents to retrieve the desired results from the MongoDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer :- The sort() method in MongoDB is used to sort the retrieved documents based on one or more fields. \n",
    "It allows you to specify the sorting order as ascending (1) or descending (-1) for each field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sort() method takes a parameter that represents the sorting criteria. This parameter can be a single \n",
    "field or a list of fields to sort by. You can also use the $meta operator to sort by a text search score\n",
    "or the $natural operator to sort by the natural order of the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB using the sort() method:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Sort documents in ascending order based on age\n",
    "results_asc = mycol.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the sorted documents\n",

    "database and collection, we insert some sample documents using the insert_many() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To sort the documents, we use the sort() method with the field name and the sorting order as parameters. \n",
    "In the example, we first sort the documents in ascending order based on the \"age\" field by passing \n",
    "\"age\": 1 to the sort() method. The 1 indicates ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We then retrieve the sorted documents using the find() method, and iterate over the cursor\n",
    "to print each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we sort the documents in descending order based on the \"age\" field by passing\n",
    "\"age\": -1 to the sort() method. The -1 indicates descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "we retrieve the sorted documents using the find() method, and iterate over the \n",
    "cursor to print each document.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer :-  The methods delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() in MongoDB are used for deleting\n",
    "data at different levels of granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. delete_one():\n",
    "The delete_one() method is used to delete a single document that matches a specified filter. \n",
    "It deletes the first document that matches the filter criteria and stops the deletion process.\n",
    "If multiple documents match the filter, only one document is deleted. It is useful when you want\n",
    "to remove a specific document from a collection without affecting other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. delete_many():\n",
    "The delete_many() method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specified filter. \n",
    "It deletes all the documents that match the filter criteria. It is useful when you want to\n",
    "delete multiple documents that meet certain conditions, such as removing all documents with\n",
    "a specific value or satisfying a particular query condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. drop():\n",
    "The drop() method is used to delete an entire collection from a database. It permanently removes \n",
    "the collection and all its associated documents. This method is a more drastic action compared to\n",
    "delete_one() and delete_many() as it completely removes the collection rather than individual\n",
    "documents. It is useful when you want to delete an entire collection and start fresh or when \n",
    "you no longer need the collection and want to free up the resources associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
