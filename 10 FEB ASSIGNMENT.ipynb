    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes the file path as a parameter and returns\n",
    "a file object that can be used to read, write, or manipulate the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"r\" (Read Mode): This is the default mode for opening a file. It allows reading the contents of the file. \n",
    "If the file doesn't exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"w\" (Write Mode): This mode is used for writing to a file. If the file exists, it will truncate the file \n",
    "(i.e., remove its contents). If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"a\" (Append Mode): This mode is used for appending data to an existing file. If the file doesn't exist,\n",
    "a new file will be created. The data is added at the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"x\" (Exclusive Creation Mode): This mode is used for creating a new file but raises a \n",
    "FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"b\" (Binary Mode): This mode is used for opening a file in binary mode, allowing reading\n",
    "or writing binary data. It is often used for non-text files, such as images, audio, or video files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \"t\" (Text Mode): This mode is used for opening a file in text mode, which is the default mode.\n",
    "It is used for reading or writing text-based files, such as plain text, CSV, or JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. \"+\" (Update Mode): This mode is used for both reading and writing to a file.\n",
    "It allows the file to be updated without truncating it. For example,\n",
    "\"r+\" allows reading and writing, while \"a+\" allows appending and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file with a specific mode, you can use the open() function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")  # Opens file.txt in read mode\n",
    "It's important to close the file after you're done with it by calling the close() \n",
    "method of the file object or using a with statement. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "# File is automatically closed outside the `with` block\n",
    "Using the appropriate mode while opening a file allows you to perform specific \n",
    "operations on the file, such as reading, writing, appending, or a combination of these actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- \n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function or method in Python is used to close an opened file.\n",
    "It is important to close a file after done working with it for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resource Management: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources,\n",
    "such as memory and file descriptors, to handle the file operations. Closing the file releases\n",
    "these resources back to the operating system. Failing to close a file can lead to resource \n",
    "leaks and may cause issues if the maximum limit of open files is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lock Release: In some operating systems, when a file is opened, it may acquire a file lock.\n",
    "Closing the file releases the lock, allowing other processes or threads to access the file. \n",
    "Failing to close a file with an acquired lock can prevent other parts of your program\n",
    "or other programs from accessing or modifying the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Integrity: When writing to a file, the data is typically stored in a buffer \n",
    "until it is flushed to the file on disk. Closing the file ensures that any pending \n",
    "data in the buffer is properly written to the file. If the file is not closed,\n",
    "the data may not be fully written, resulting in data loss or inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. File Corruption: If a file is opened in write mode or append mode and not properly closed,\n",
    "subsequent operations on the file may result in file corruption or incomplete writes.\n",
    "Closing the file ensures that the file is properly finalized and avoids potential\n",
    "issues when reopening or working with the file in the future.\n",

    "Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then\n",
    "close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-  Python program that creates a text file, writes the content \"I want to become a Data Scientist\" into it,\n",
    "closes the file, and then opens and reads the content from the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and write content to the file\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open and read the content from the file\n",

    "\n",
    "# Print the content\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This program creates a file named \"data.txt\" using the open() function with mode \"w\" (write mode) \n",
    "and writes the specified content into the file using the write() method of the file object. \n",
    "After writing the content, the file is automatically closed due to the with statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the program opens the file again using the open() function with mode \"r\" (read mode) and \n",
    "reads the content from the file using the read() method of the file object. \n",
    "The content is stored in the content variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the program prints the content, which in this case will be \n",
    "\"I want to become a Data Scientist\" since that is the content written to the file.\n",

    "Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :-   The following are three methods in Python that can be used to read data from a\n",
    "file: read(), readline(), and readlines().\n",
    "Let's explore each method with example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read(): This method is used to read the entire content of a file as a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the read() method is called on the file object,\n",
    "which reads the entire content of the file and\n",
    "assigns it to the content variable. Then, the content is printed,\n",
    "which will be a single string containing the entire file content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "    line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Line 1:\", line1)\n",
    "print(\"Line 2:\", line2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the readline() method is called twice on the file object,\n",
    "which reads the first and second lines of the file and assigns them to the \n",
    "line1 and line2 variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the lines are printed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and\n",
    "open() together?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- The with statement in Python is used with the open() function to provide a context \n",
    "manager for file operations. It ensures that the file is properly and automatically \n",
    "closed after the block of code within the with statement is executed, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using the with statement and open() together is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automatic Resource Management: The with statement automatically takes care of opening \n",
    "and closing the file. It guarantees that the file is closed properly, regardless \n",
    "of how the block of code within the with statement is exited—whether\n",
    "it's due to an exception, a return statement, or reaching the end of the block. \n",
    "This ensures proper resource management and avoids resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exception Handling: The with statement handles exceptions raised within the block of code. \n",
    "If an exception occurs during file operations, the with statement ensures that the\n",
    "file is closed properly, even if an exception is raised. This helps maintain \n",
    "the integrity of the file and handles any errors that may occur during file processing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "\n",
    "# File is automatically closed outside the `with` block\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the with statement is used with the open() function to read the \n",
    "contents of a file. The file is automatically closed once \n",
    "the with block is exited, regardless of how the block is exited\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cleaner and More Readable Code: By using the with statement, the code becomes \n",
    "cleaner and more readable. The file opening and closing logic is encapsulated \n",
    "within the with block, making it clear and concise. It eliminates the need \n",
    "for explicit open() and close() calls, reducing the chances of forgetting to close the File.\n",

    "Q6. Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- The write() and writelines() functions in Python are used to write\n",
    "data to a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "explore each function along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "write(): This function is used to write a string or binary data to a file.\n",

    "\n",
    "print(\"Data written successfully.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the write() function is called on the file object to write data\n",
    "to the file. Two strings are written using the write() function. The newline \n",
    "character \\n is used to write a new line after the first string. After writing\n",
    "the data, the file is closed automatically due to the with statement. \n",
    "The program then prints \"Data written successfully\"\n",
    "to indicate that the data has been successfully written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "writelines(): This function is used to write a list of strings to a file.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "lines = [\"Line 1\\n\", \"Line 2\\n\", \"Line 3\\n\"]\n",
