    "What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER - ABSTRACTION IS A PROCESS OF HIDING THE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND SHOWING ONLY FUNCTIONALITY TO THEIR USER\n",
    "\n",
    "FOR EXAMPLE :- WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING THE CAR LIKE START/ STOP THE CAR, ACCELERATE / BREAK ETC.\n",

    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER - ABSTRACTION IS A FEATURE OF OOPS THAT HIDES THE UNNECESSARY DETAILS BUT SHOWS THE \n",
    "ESSENTIAL INFORMATION, ENCAPSULATION IS ALSO A FEATURE OF OOPS, IT HIDES THE CODE AND DATE \n",

    "ANSWER - ABC STANDS FOR ( ABSTRACT BASE CLASS ) ABC MODULE PYTHON PROVIDES AN EASY\n",
    "WAY OF CREATING AN ABSTRACT BASE CLASS THROUGH A BUILD - IN MODULE.\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER - ABSTRACTION IS ACHIEVED BY HAVING IMPLEMENTATIONS WITH CONCRETE METHODS\n",
    "FULL ABSTRACTION IS ACHIEVED USING INTERFACE WITH ABSTRACT TYPES THAT SPECIFY A CLASS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER - WE CANNOT INSTANTIATE AN ABSTRACT CLASS BECAUSE IT IS ABSTRACT IT IS NOT COMPLETE HENCE IT CANNOT BE USED.\n",
