    "Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "answer :- To create a Bokeh plot using Python, we need to follow the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Bokeh: Begin by installing the Bokeh library if you haven't already. You can use pip to install\n",
    "it by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "pip install bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import the necessary modules: In your Python script or Jupyter Notebook, import the required modules from Bokeh:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set up the output environment: If you're using Jupyter Notebook, you'll need to set up the Bokeh output to \n",
    "display inline. If you're using a different environment or want to save the plot to a file, you can choose\n",
    "the appropriate output method. To display the plot inline, use the following code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "output_notebook()\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a figure: Use the figure() function to create a new figure object that will hold your plot:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add data to the figure: we can add various types of data to your figure, such as points, lines,\n",
    "bars, etc. For example, to add a scatter plot, use the circle() method and provide the x and y \n",
    "coordinates of the points:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "p.circle(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Customize the plot: Bokeh provides numerous options for customizing your plot. You can set\n",
    "attributes such as title, axes labels, plot size, colors, and more. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "p.title.text = \"My Bokeh Plot\"\n",
    "p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis\"\n",
    "p.yaxis.axis_label = \"Y-axis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Display the plot: Finally, use the show() function to display the plot:\n",
    "    \n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, here's an example of a simple Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up the output environment\n",
    "output_notebook()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add data to the figure\n",
    "p.circle(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Customize the plot\n",
    "p.title.text = \"My Bokeh Plot\"\n",
    "p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis\"\n",
    "p.yaxis.axis_label = \"Y-axis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up the output environment\n",
    "output_notebook()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add data to the figure\n",
    "p.circle(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Customize the plot\n",
    "p.title.text = \"My Bokeh Plot\"\n",
    "p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis\"\n",
    "p.yaxis.axis_label = \"Y-axis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic example, and there are many more features and options you can explore in the Bokeh\n",
    "library to create more complex and interactive plots.\n",

    "Q2. What are glyphs in Bokeh, and how can you add them to a Bokeh plot? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- In Bokeh, glyphs are the visual markers that represent data on a plot. They can be used\n",
    "to create various types of plots, such as scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and more. Glyphs\n",
    "are added to a Bokeh plot using the glyph() method of the figure object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of adding glyphs to a scatter plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up the output environment\n",
    "output_notebook()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add data to the figure using glyphs\n",
    "p.circle(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6], size=10, fill_color='blue')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a scatter plot by adding circles as glyphs. The circle() method is used\n",
    "to add the glyphs to the figure. The x and y parameters provide the coordinates of the data points,\n",
    "and size  sets the size of the circles. The fill_color parameter determines the color of the circles,\n",
    "which is set to 'blue' in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the appearance of glyphs by passing additional parameters to the circle() method. \n",
    "Here are a few commonly used parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "size: Specifies the size of the glyphs.\n",
    ". color or fill_color: Sets the color of the glyphs.\n",
    ". line_color: Determines the color of the outline or border of the glyphs.\n",
    ". line_width: Sets the width of the outline or border.\n",
    ". alpha: Specifies the transparency of the glyphs (0.0 to 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's modify the previous example to add more customization:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add data to the figure using glyphs with customized attributes\n",
    "p.circle(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6], size=20, fill_color='blue', line_color='black', line_width=2, alpha=0.8)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this modified example, we increased the size of the circles, set the outline color to black, \n",
    "increased the line width, and adjusted the transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh provides various glyph methods, such as circle(), square(), line(), vbar(), hbar(), and many more,\n",
    "allowing you to create different types of plots. Each glyph method has its specific parameters for\n",
    "customization. You can refer to the Bokeh documentation for a comprehensive list \n",
    "of available glyphs and their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How can you customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- To customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend, \n",
    "WE can use various attributes and methods provided by the Bokeh library.\n",
    "Here's an overview of how you can customize these elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Axes customization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Axis labels: WE can set the labels for the x-axis and y-axis using the xaxis.axis_label \n",
    "and yaxis.axis_label attributes of the figure object. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis Label\"\n",
    "p.yaxis.axis_label = \"Y-axis Label\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Axis limits: WE can set the lower and upper limits of the x-axis and y-axis using\n",
    "the x_range and y_range attributes of the figure object. For example, to set\n",
    "the x-axis limits from 0 to 10:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "p.x_range = (0, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    ". Ticks and tick labels: WE can customize the ticks and tick labels of the axes using the\n",
    "xaxis.ticker and yaxis.ticker attributes. For example, to set specific tick values on the x-axis:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "p.xaxis.ticker = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    ". Grid lines: WE can control the display of grid lines using the xgrid.grid_line_color \n",
    "and ygrid.grid_line_color attributes. For example, to hide the grid lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "p.xgrid.grid_line_color = None\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Title customization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot title:WE can set the title of the plot using the title.text attribute of the figure object.\n",
    "For example\n",
    "p.title.text = \"My Bokeh Plot\"\n",
    "\n",
    ". Title styling: WE can customize the styling of the plot title using various attributes like \n",
    "title.text_font_size, title.text_font_style, and title.text_color. For example, \n",
    "to increase the font size of the title:\n",
    "    \n",
    "p.title.text_font_size = \"18pt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Legend customization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a legend: WE can add a legend to your plot by assigning a unique value to the\n",
    "legend_label parameter in the glyph methods. For example, when adding multiple scatter plots:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "p.circle(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6], legend_label=\"Data 1\")\n",
    "p.circle(x=[4, 5, 6], y=[7, 8, 9], legend_label=\"Data 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ". Legend position: WE can control the position of the legend using the legend.location attribute.\n",
    "Common values are \"top_left\", \"top_right\", \"bottom_left\", \"bottom_right\", and \"center\". For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "p.legend.location = \"top_right\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Legend styling: WE can customize the appearance of the legend using various attributes like legend.\n",
    "label_text_font_size, legend.label_text_color, and legend.background_fill_color.\n",
    "For example, to change the font size of the legend labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "p.legend.label_text_font_size = \"12pt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the customization options available in Bokeh.\n",
    "WE can explore the Bokeh documentation to discover more attributes and methods \n",
    "for customizing the appearance of your plots.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. What is a Bokeh server, and how can you use it to create interactive plots that can be updated in\n",
    "real time?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER :- The Bokeh server is a Python library and server application that allows to create \n",
    "interactive plots that can be updated in real time. With the Bokeh server, you can build web-based\n",
    "applications or dashboards that respond to user interactions or update based on changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of how you can use the Bokeh server to create interactive plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Bokeh library: need to install the Bokeh library using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import the necessary modules: In your Python script, import the required modules from Bokeh\n",
    "for creating and running the Bokeh server application:\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, curdoc\n",
    "from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a figure and data source: Set up the initial plot by creating a figure object \n",
    "and a data source to hold the data that will be updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=[], y=[]))\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the interactive elements: Add interactive elements to your plot, such as buttons,\n",
    "sliders, or dropdowns, that will trigger updates or changes in the data:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Example: Adding a button to update the data\n",
    "button = Button(label=\"Update\", button_type=\"success\")\n",
    "def update_data():\n",
    "    # Code to update the data in the data source\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "button.on_click(update_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Update the plot based on changes: Define a function that will update the plot based \n",
    "on the changes in the data source:\n",
    "\n",
    "def update_plot():\n",
    "    # Code to update the plot based on the data source\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Add the plot and elements to the document: Add the plot and interactive elements\n",
    "to the Bokeh document (curdoc) that will be served by the Bokeh server:\n",
    "\n",
